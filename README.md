Fiddler-SharePoint-Designer-Settings
====================================

With this Fiddler extension you can activate SharePoint Designer access to a SharePoint site, even if it has been disabled by the administrator.
If you start SharePoint Designer, the server send a flag wether SharePoint Designer is allowed or not. This Fiddler extension rewrites this and some other flags, to "re-enable" SharePoint Designer.
Please keep in mind that you still need the necessary permissions to make any changes.

I've tested the "hack" on SharePoint 2010 and 2013.
